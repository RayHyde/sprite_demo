<h1>How does a sprite.png work?</h1>

<h2>A demo to explain the concept to someone new to image sprites</h2>

<p>The concept of a sprite.png is easily understood when it is seen in action. The demo shows how a sprite.png moves under an element and shows the resulting CSS.</p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
